# Item-021: Create Implementation Status Tracker

**Status:** 🟢 Ready  
**Priority:** P2 - MEDIUM  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Created:** 2026-01-06  
**Owner:** TBD

## Problem Statement

Specifications define features but tracking spec/code alignment requires manual cross-referencing. Need centralized tracker documenting which specs are implemented, partially implemented, or planned.

---

## Affected Files

**Create:** [spec/spec-implementation-status.md](../../spec/spec-implementation-status.md) (new)

## Detailed Tasks

- [ ] Create spec-implementation-status.md
- [ ] Build matrix: Entity, Field, Spec vs Code, Gap, Priority
- [ ] Identify all implementation gaps
- [ ] Prioritize gaps
- [ ] Link gaps to backlog items
- [ ] Document maintenance process

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tracker created
- [ ] All major gaps documented
- [ ] Prioritized
- [ ] Linked to backlog
- [ ] Used in sprint planning

## Definition of Done

- [x] Tracker created
- [x] Comprehensive

## Notes

- This becomes source of truth for spec/code alignment
- Review during code reviews
- Update when specs or code changes
