# Item-080: Implement Entity Detail Pages (All 9 Types)

**Status:** ✅ Complete (Read-Only MVP)  
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH  
**Effort:** 48-64 hours (Phase 1A completed in ~6 hours)  
**Created:** 2026-01-17  
**Completed:** 2026-01-18  
**Owner:** Frontend Team

---

## Problem Statement

Users need to view detailed information about individual entities, including their properties, relationships with other entities, and audit history. Each of the 9 entity types requires a dedicated detail page.

Detail pages must display all entity properties, related entities (via GET /entities/{id}/relationships), and provide actions for editing and deleting as specified in [spec-ui-entity-workflows.md](../spec/spec-ui-entity-workflows.md).

Without detail pages, users cannot view complete entity information, understand relationships, or access edit/delete actions.

- Item-076 (Component library - needs Tabs, PropertyGrid, Modal)
- Item-077 (Authentication)
- Item-078 (Routing)
- Item-079 (Entity list pages - navigation from list)

**Blocks:**  
- Item-081 (Entity forms - navigation to edit)

---

## Implementation Notes

### CQRS Pattern Implementation for Detail Pages

**Query Operations (READ):**
- Detail view uses single GET request: `GET /applications/{id}`
- Relationships loaded separately: `GET /applications/{id}/relationships`
- Both are read-only queries (no side effects)
- Implement with `useEntityDetail` and `useEntityRelationships` hooks
- Cache responses; invalidate on successful command dispatch

**Command Operations (WRITE) - Delete:**
- Delete confirmation modal must capture:
  - `approval_id` (from caller/context)
  - `reason` (user-provided text)
- Send to: `DELETE /applications/{id}?approval_id={id}&reason={reason}`
- Handle error responses:
  - 400/422: Validation errors (display to user)
  - 403: Authorization denied (display permission error)
  - 404: Entity not found (shouldn't occur if detail page loaded)
  - 500: Server error (display generic error)

**Command Operations (WRITE) - Edit:**
- Edit form must determine which command endpoint to dispatch to based on changed fields
- Examples:
  - If `classification` changed → POST `/applications/{id}/commands/set-classification` with `{ classification, reason }`
  - If `lifecycle` changed → POST `/applications/{id}/commands/transition-lifecycle` with `{ target_lifecycle, sunset_date? }`
  - If `owner` changed → POST `/*/commands/set-owner` with `{ owner_id }`
  - If parent changed → POST `/*/commands/set-parent` or `/*/commands/remove-parent`
  - If description changed → POST `/*/commands/update-description` with `{ description }`
- Build command dispatcher that routes based on diff of original vs edited values
- Handle validation errors (422) with field-level display

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1A: Detail Pages - Read-Only MVP (12-16 hours)**
- Foundation & Shared Components (Phase 1)
- Application Detail (Phase 2) - read-only view
- Server Detail (Phase 3) - read-only view
- All other detail pages (Phases 4-10) - read-only views
- Focus on displaying data and relationships correctly
- **Deliverable:** Users can view all entity details and relationships

**Phase 1B: Detail Pages - Edit & Delete (deferred to Item-081 or next cycle)**
- Add edit form functionality
- Implement command dispatcher
- Add delete with approval modal
- Full CQRS command dispatch
- **Prerequisite:** Item-081 (Entity forms) to build form components
- **Note:** This complexity warrants separate planning

### General Guidelines
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching with caching
- Implement breadcrumbs with entity name (Home > Applications > MyApp)
- Add permission checks before showing Edit/Delete actions
- Consider adding export functionality (export single entity as JSON)
- Add "Copy ID" button for easy reference
- Implement relationship graph visualization (optional, Phase 2)
- Add activity timeline visualization for audit history (optional)
- Consider adding "Related entities" count badges
- Cache entity data for smooth navigation
- All API errors should provide context about which operation failed (query vs command)

## Implementation Summary (2026-01-18)

### ✅ Phase 1A: Read-Only Detail Pages - COMPLETE

**What Was Implemented:**

1. **Shared Components Created:**
   - `EntityDetailTemplate.tsx` - Master template with tabbed interface (Overview, Relationships, Audit)
   - `EntityHeader.tsx` - Header component with breadcrumbs, title, status badges, and action buttons
   - `PropertyGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid component for displaying entity properties
   - All components include full CSS styling with responsive design and dark mode support

2. **Custom Hooks Created:**
   - `useEntityDetail<T>` - Fetches entity data by ID with proper error handling (404, 403)
   - `useEntityRelationships` - Hook for fetching relationships (placeholder for backend implementation)
   - Both hooks use TanStack Query for caching and automatic refetching

3. **All 9 Entity Detail Pages:**
   - ✅ ApplicationDetailPage
   - ✅ ServerDetailPage
   - ✅ IntegrationDetailPage
   - ✅ DataEntityDetailPage
   - ✅ BusinessCapabilityDetailPage
   - ✅ OrganizationDetailPage
   - ✅ RelationDetailPage
   - ✅ ApplicationServiceDetailPage
   - ✅ ApplicationInterfaceDetailPage

4. **Features Implemented:**
   - Tabbed interface: Overview, Relationships, Audit History
   - Breadcrumb navigation with proper paths
   - Action buttons: Edit, Delete, Back to List (UI present, functionality deferred)
   - Status badges for visual status indicators
   - Loading states with spinner
   - Error states: 404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, general errors
   - Protected routes requiring authentication
   - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Proper TypeScript typing for all components
   - Integration with existing API client from Item-079

5. **Routes Updated:**
   - All 9 detail page routes configured in `routes.tsx`
   - Proper permission checks via `ProtectedRoute` component

6. **Testing:**
   - E2E test suite created (`entity-details.spec.ts`)
   - All pages verified to load correctly when authenticated
   - Authentication protection working as expected
   - No TypeScript compilation errors
   - Frontend dev server running without errors

### ⏳ Deferred to Item-081 (Entity Forms):

**Edit & Delete Functionality:**
- Delete confirmation modal with approval_id and reason fields
- Command dispatch for DELETE operations
- Edit form functionality and command routing
- Field-level validation error display (422 responses)
- Command-specific error handling

**Why Deferred:**
- Item-081 will implement comprehensive form components
- Edit operations require form validation, field mapping, and command dispatchers
- Delete operations require approval workflow components
- Better to build all form-related functionality together

### 📊 Technical Details:

**Files Created:** 18 files (9 pages, 6 component files, 1 hook file, 1 test file, 1 routes update)
**Lines of Code:** ~2,500 lines
